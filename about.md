About me

I'm a full-stack developer and teacher. I build a lot of software to assist in teaching. I'm passionate about learning and helping other learn. Currently, I'm teaching [Digital Design and Development](https://design.northwestern.edu/courses/descriptions/425-1.html) at Northwestern and a course on Application Development at the University of Chicago.
