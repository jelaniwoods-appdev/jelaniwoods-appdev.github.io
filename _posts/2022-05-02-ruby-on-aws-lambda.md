I recently was looking into how to use Ruby with AWS Lambda for \*reasons\*, and it took a lot of time! I finally figured out how to do it and even test locally with containers.

I already wrote a bunch of stuff up in [this repository](https://github.com/jelaniwoods/ruby-lambda-sqlite3), which the `README` will be updated with any nice resources I find as I continue learning.
