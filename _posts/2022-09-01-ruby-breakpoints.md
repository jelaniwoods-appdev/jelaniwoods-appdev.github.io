# Adding "breakpoints" to help you debug a Ruby program

Sometimes when you are debugging a Ruby script, you want to do *more* than just print variables to debug. It'd be nice to pause the program at a particular moment and actually interact with all the variables that have been defined up until that point. Turns out, you can do this by adding breakpoints to your script.

Breakpoints can be added to your Ruby script using the `pry` library, which is a part of the standard Ruby library, but isn't automatically loaded. You can load the library with `require "pry"`.

### Pry basics

Let's say we have a program like this:

```
list_of_people = [
  { :name => "James", :age => 16 },
  { :name => "Yolanda", :age => 26 },
  { :name => "Mel", :age => 15 }
]

p "Enter an age and we'll tell you if we know a person who is that old:"

age_to_find = gets.chomp

list_of_people.each do |person|
  if person.fetch(:age) == age_to_find
    p "Found it!"
	end
end
```

Even when I enter an age that I _know_ should be found, like `16`, my program doesn't print `"Found it!"` like I expect.

Using `pry`, I can use `binding.pry` to add a breakpoint before the `if` statement so I can interact more with the variables that were created.

```rb
list_of_people = [
  { :name => "James", :age => 16 },
  { :name => "Yolanda", :age => 26 },
  { :name => "Mel", :age => 15 }
]

p "Enter an age and we'll tell you if we know a person who is that old:"

age_to_find = gets.chomp

list_of_people.each do |person|
	binding.pry
  if person.fetch(:age) == age_to_find
    p "Found it!"
	end
end
```

Now when you run the program it doesn't completeâ€”

You can use an IRB console to interact with the code that has run so far.

Now I can access variables like `age_to_find` and `person` that were defined before the breakpoint to see why the condition for my `if` statement never evaluates to `true`.

Ah, the ol' forget-to-convert-a-`String`-into-an-`Integer` error. Gets me everytime ðŸ¤¦. Now I know to convert `age_to_find` to an `Integer`.

You can type `exit` when you're done to un-pause the programs execution.
