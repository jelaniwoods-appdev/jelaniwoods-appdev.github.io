Notes on how to interact with a client on a project

blease ask a LOT of questions. Specify everything.
Don't let the client simplify an explanation of how they want things to work.

Challenge their suggestions; they might _think_ they know what they want, but they probably don't actually know what they want. It's your job to find out what they actually want and what the best way to implement the feature the want is.

Of course if they're really adamant about doing something non-conventional, you kinda just have to do it.

Update them on everything you're doing with bullet points about what the user can and cannot do, what you think the specifications are, provide gifs of the features working.

Don't trust them to click around the app for themselves, they have other things to worry about.

If you think you aren't getting enough feedback on your progress, meet with them and walk them through your changes and anything you're unsure of. They might not catch a misunderstanding of a feature set in an email, but they should catch you on it during a meeting.
