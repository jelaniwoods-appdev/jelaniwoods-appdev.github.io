title: XCode Developer Cache

In the eternal journey of freeing up more memory, I noticed that the storage management settings on my laptop (MacOS 12) had a new section for "developer cache".

Not only do I _not_ know what is does, it also was taking up a lotta space!

It turns out all of this "cache" is related to writing code for apple products which is not why I have xcode installed (I just need it for Ruby I think). So deleting the cache is safe to do, but it will keep coming back.

To prevent that from happening, you need to open xcode (which actually made me install something else ðŸ˜ ) and delete all of the simulators.

Menu > Window > Devices > Simulators 

then highlight and delete!
