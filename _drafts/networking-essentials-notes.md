LAN - Local Area Network, network of users tha tshare computer resources in a limited area.

LANs are defined by **protocal** and **topology** used for accessing the network.

Protocal - set of rules for sers to exchange information
Topology- the network architecture that interconnects the <u>networking equipment</u>

(what constitutes "networking equipment"?)

Common architectures for LAN:
- Ring
- Bus
- Star

Ring - called "Token Ring", a "toke

IEEE - Institure of Electrical and Electronics Engineers - a major standards-setting body for technological development
