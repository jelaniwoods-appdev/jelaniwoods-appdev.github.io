RSS - Really Simple Syndication
Web Feed - Web Feed is a data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. 
Web Syndication - Web syndication is making content available from one website to other sites. Most commonly, websites are made available to provide either summaries or full renditions of a website's recently added content.

With those definitions, it sounds like RSS is a data format to allow websites to send data to one another. The way that this data is communicated is by "subscribing" to a channel (by pasting the feed URL into a feed reader). Then when the feed updates, all subscribers receive the news?
