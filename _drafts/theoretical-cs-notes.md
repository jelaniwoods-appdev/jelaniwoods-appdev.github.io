## Propositions

Propositional Logic vs Predicate Logic

> A proposition is a statement which is true or false (but never both!). For example, "Urbana is in Illinois" or `2 ≤ 15`. It can’t be a question. It also can’t contain variables, e.g. `x ≤ 9` isn’t a proposition. Sentence fragments without verbs (e.g. "bright blue flowers") or arithmetic expressions (e.g. `5 + 17`), aren’t propositions because they don’t state a claim.
